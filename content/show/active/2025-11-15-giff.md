GIFF is the `Geocaching International Film Festival` and 2025 is the 25th anniversary of Geocaching.  So, come discover what Geocaching is (somebody in the audience is bound to know) and meet Iowa's geocaching family.  Well, a good portion of it anyway.  

There's a meal and The Basement Band after the films, too!
