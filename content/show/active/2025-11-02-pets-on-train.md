CANCELED due to equipment issues at the Wieting! Sorry for the inconvenience. We hope to be back soon.  

When a crew of animal bandits embark on a routine swindle, they find themselves caught up in a train heist. It's up to Falcon, a petty thief raccoon, and Rex, a righteous police-dog, to save the animals on this high-speed runway train.
