    note: Join us on Saturday, December 14, at The Wieting Theatre for a fun-filled evening of holiday cheer and community connection. The night kicks off with a soup supper at 5:00 p.m., followed by a group sing-along at 6:00 p.m. Whether you're a seasoned singer or just enjoy humming along, this event is for everyone—no singing experience needed! A pianist and song leaders will guide the group in singing classic Christmas carols, and there will also be some holiday-themed performances throughout the evening from a variety of community members.
