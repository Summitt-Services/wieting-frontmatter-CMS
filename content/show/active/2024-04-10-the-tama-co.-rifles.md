The Rifles were Tama County's first military company organized for the Civil War. As Company C in the 10th Iowa Infantry, the Rifles were part of some of the war's most important campaigns, from the Siege of Vicksburg to Sherman's March to the Sea. Drawing on numerous sources -- including letters and journals written by the men themselves-- we'll explore their lives, their service, and their sacrifices, as well as the families and communities they left behind.
