Mary Swander’s new play, ‘Coop,’ is historical fiction, an enactment of true stories of Amish, Mennonite, and other conscientious objectors during WWI and WWII. One group of C.O.s was told they were to fight forest fires in Colorado, but instead they were interned in a chicken coop. ‘Coop’ is a one-person play performed by Rip Russell. Don't miss the performances of this ‘object theatre' with discussion session sponsored by Humanities Iowa with Previous Iowa Poet Laureate, Mary Swander, immediately following the play.
