Alice Garrick is the Executive Director and has worked for the past 33 years with Women Development Services (WDS) a ministry aiming to make a better life for women and their children. WDS very often helps restore the lost human dignity to our women and girls, who are living in the most vulnerable situation, and reweaves the torn fabric of society. Beautiful garments, jewelry, and accessories made by Pakistani women are available to purchase to support those women who live in a very poor and politically unstable region.
