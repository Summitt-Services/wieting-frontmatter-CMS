A comedy from Tina Fey comes as a new twist on the modern classic, MEAN GIRLS. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called "The Plastics," ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Rene√© Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika).
