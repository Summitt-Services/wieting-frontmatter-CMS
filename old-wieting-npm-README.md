# wieting-npm

This repository is the new home for https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com.  It's a Hugo website with an `npm` wrapper supporing Javascript functions.  This repo was built from https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-one-click-hugo-cms which has been archived.  

The old `README.md` file from that original project is preserved here as `old-Netlify-version-README.md` for reference.  

## Local Development  

To run this project locally you should clone it (or `git pull`) and then from the project root directory run `npm run serve`.  This should generate a local `http://localhost:1313` copy of the website for evaluation and debugging.
